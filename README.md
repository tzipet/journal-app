Journal app is a web application for downloading and submitting scientific researches and papers, using blockchain technologies as the back-end of the application. It was developed as a thesis project during the last year of my masterâ€™s degree. The front-end part of the application was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the back-end of the application was created using the [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) programming language with the [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/) public blockchain as the core of the application. This repository holds only the front-end part of the app. The back-end part sits in [tzipet/journal-app-core](https://github.com/tzipet/journal-app-core).

### How to run the app locally

First install npm dependencies with `npm install` and then you can run the app with `npm start`.
